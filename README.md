A super-directory of workshop-related stuff. Meant to help me practice with submodules. But also (with luck) should be a central, reproducible repo for my actual workshop talks, etc.

Themes 
======

Turned on and off by editing beamer.tmp
* So far, really only two themes: plain and ici3d

Banners: LatexTemplates/ici3dCurrent.tex 
	* also check \years in copyright for each .txt file

Content
	* stats: medset, etc., make rules (in stats; nothing implemented here)
	* disease: Selection is controlled from local.txt.format. Could copy the stats style, but so far not a lot of selection going on
