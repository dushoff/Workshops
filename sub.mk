## I think this rule will only be used once per repo.
## It's here in case I decide to automatically copy it
$(ms):
	git submodule add git@github.com:dushoff/$@.git

## It looks like git clone is making the subdirectory, so we need to focus on making the files
## Don't use a dependency here, as it will lead to re-initialization
## The recursive make is also mostly useless â€¦:
$(ms)/%.mk: 
	$(MAKE) $(ms)
	git submodule init $(ms) 
	git submodule update $(ms)
