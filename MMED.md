### Wednesday, 29 May

8:30 – 9:15 **Lecture:** Consequences of heterogeneity, and modeling
    options ([Dushoff](../team/dushoff))

9:15 – 10:15 **Computer Session:** [R Tutorials](../tutorials) - Lab
    2: Consequences of heterogeneity ([Dushoff](../team/dushoff),
    [Mhlanga](../team/mhlanga), [Mthombothi](../team/mthombothi),
    [Sempa](../team/sempa), [Welte](../team/welte))
      - You will need the most recent version of the ICI3D R package for
        this tutorial. If you are using your laptop for the tutorials,
        please update the package before you begin by running the
        command **`devtools::install_github('ICI3D/ici3d-pkg')`** in R
        studio.
      - To run the tutorial, first load the ICI3D R package
        (**`library('ICI3D')`**), then load the tutorial
        (**`heterogeneityTutorial()`**).
      - Lab 2 Summary ([Mhlanga](../team/Mhlanga))

11:00 – 12:30 **Computer Session:** Harare data in groups of \<4

    [Hargrove](../team/hargrove), [Mwangi](../team/mwangi),
    [Welte](../team/welte))
      - You will need the ICI3D R package for this tutorial.
      - To run the tutorial, first load the ICI3D R package
        (**`require('ICI3D')`**), then load the tutorial
        (**`hivTutorial()`**).
      - If you finish all five versions of the model for the Harare data
        before lunch, move on to working on data from other countries.
